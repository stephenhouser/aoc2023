# Day 1: Trebuchet?!

## Part One

- Combine the first and last digit of each line to form a two-digit number
- The answer is the sum of those numbers

```
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
```

Example answer: _142_ (12 + 38 + 15 + 77)

## Part Two

- Same as Part One
- Digits now include the names of the digits, e.g. `one` -> `1`
- Digits can appear at the start, end, in the middle

Example:

```
two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen
```

Example answer: _281_ (29 + 83 + 13 + 24 + 42 + 14 + 76)
