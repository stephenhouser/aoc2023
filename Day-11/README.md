# Day 11: Cosmic Expansion

[Advent of Code 2023 -- Day 11](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/11)

## Part One

- input is map of space, `.` is empty, `#` is a galaxy
- completely blank rows or columns (containing only `.`s) represent two (2) rows or columns. These should be "expanded"
- find all the pairwise distances between galaxies using only up, down, left, and right movement.
- answer is the sum of all those distances

Example:

```
...#......
.......#..
#.........
..........
......#...
.#........
.........#
..........
.......#..
#...#.....
```

Expands to:

```
....#........
.........#...
#............
.............
.............
........#....
.#...........
............#
.............
.............
.........#...
#....#.......
```

Distance is not euclidian distance, but the "step" distance along the grid.

```
....1........
.........2...
3............
.............
.............
........4....
.5...........
.##.........6
..##.........
...##........
....##...7...
8....9.......
```

The distance here, between `5` and `9` is `9`

Example answer: _374_

Answer: _9742154_

## Part Two

- instead of empty rows and columns expanding to two (2) they expand to 1,000,000
- answer is same sum of distances

Example answer for expansion of 10: _1030_
Example answer for expansion of 100: _8410_

Answer: _411142919886_
